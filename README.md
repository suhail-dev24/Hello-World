# Hello-World
This is my first own repo, hope it flows with lots and lots efficient codes
So here it is my first task to complete git and github tutorial

Adding a sample basic java code that everyone knows!!!
package simplePrograms;

public class Program1 {
	public static void main(String args[]){  
	     System.out.println("Hello Java");  
	    }  

}
